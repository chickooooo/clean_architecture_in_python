# Clean Architecture in Python

This project defines the structure to implement `Clean Architecture` in Python.<br>

<br>

The architecture of the project is such that, main components like `Entities`, `Usecases` and `Datasources` are decoupled from each other. This helps with testing each component sepertately without being dependent on the other.<br>
Please refer to `/tests` folder to see how we can test these components using unit tests.
<br>

<br>

Clean Architecture also supports Test Driven Development (TDD).
